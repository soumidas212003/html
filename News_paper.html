    <h3><p>NEW DELHI: The Test matches in India are mostly played on rank turners and Indian spinners become unplayable in these conditions as they make the opposition batsmen dance on their tunes.<br>Come the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, India's premier off spinner Ravichandran Ashwin will play a decisive role in the outcome of the four-match test series, believes former India head coach Ravi Shastri.<br>"If Ashwin is on fire, that might decide the outcome of the series. He is world class in most conditions but in Indian conditions, he is lethal. If the ball starts spinning and there is enough bite off the surface, he will trouble most batters," Shastri said.</p></h3>
